            <br><p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Creatine is an organic compound with the nominal formula (H2N)(HN)CN(CH3)CH2CO2H. 
                It exists in various modifications (tautomers) in solution. 
                Creatine is found in vertebrates where it facilitates recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), primarily in muscle and brain tissue.
                Recycling is achieved by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP via donation of phosphate groups. Creatine also acts as a buffer.

            <br> <h2 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Metabolic role</h2>
            <br> <p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Creatine is a naturally occurring non-protein compound of which the primary metabolic role is to combine creatine with a phosphoryl group to generate phosphocreatine, which is used to regenerate ATP or adenosine triphosphate. Most of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle (95%), while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, testes, and other tissues. The average amount of total creatine (creatine and phosphocreatine) stored in the body is approximately 120 mmol/kg of dry muscle mass. However, the upper limit of creatine storage post supplementation and dietary intervention is believed to be around 160 mmol/kg. Studies have also shown that 1–2% of intramuscular creatine is degraded per day and an individual would need to consume about 1–3 grams of creatine per day to maintain average (unsupplemented) creatine storage. For most individuals about half (1 g/day) of this daily need is consumed from an omnivorous diet, while the remaining amount is synthesized in the liver and kidneys.</p>
            <br> <h2 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Research</h2>
            <br> <h3 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Cognitive performance</h3>
            <br> <p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Creatine is reported have a beneficial effect on brain function and cognitive processing, although the evidence is difficult to interpret systematically and the appropriate dosing is unknown. The greatest effects appears to be in individuals who are stressed (due, for instance, to sleep deprivation) or cognitively impaired.</p>
            <br> <h3 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Muscular disease</h3>
            <br> <p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">A meta-analysis found that creatine treatment increased muscle strength in muscular dystrophies, and potentially improved functional performance. Creatine treatment does not appear to improve muscle strength in people who have metabolic myopathies. According to a clinical study focusing on people with various muscular dystrophies, using a pure form of creatine monohydrate can be beneficial in rehabilitation after injuries and immobilization </p>
            <br><hr><h1 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Branched-chain amino acid</h1>
            <br> <p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">A branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) is an amino acid having an aliphatic side-chain with a branch (a central carbon atom bound to three or more carbon atoms). Among the proteinogenic amino acids, there are three BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Non-proteinogenic BCAAs include 2-aminoisobutyric acid. The three proteinogenic BCAAs are among the nine essential amino acids for humans, accounting for 35% of the essential amino acids in muscle proteins and 40% of the preformed amino acids required by mammals. Synthesis for BCAAs occurs in all locations of plants, within the plastids of the cell, as determined by presence of mRNAs which encode for enzymes in the metabolic pathway.</p>
            <br><h2 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Requirements</h2>
            <br><p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">For leucine, for adults 19 years and older, 42 mg/kg body weight/day; for isoleucine 19 mg/kg body weight/day; for valine 24 mg/kg body weight/day. For a 70 kg (154 lb) person this equates to 2.9, 1.3 and 1.7 g/day. Diets that meet or exceed the RDA for total protein (0.8 g/kg/day; 56 grams for a 70 kg person), meet or exceed the RDAs for branched-chain amino acids.</p>
            <br><h2 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Research</h2>
            <br> <p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Dietary BCAAs have been used in an attempt to treat some cases of hepatic encephalopathy. They can have the effect of alleviating symptoms of hepatic encephalophathy, but there is no evidence they benefit mortality rates, nutrition, or overall quality of life as further research is necessary. Blood levels of the BCAAs are elevated in obese, insulin resistant humans and in mouse and rat models of diet-induced diabetes, suggesting the possibility that BCAAs contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. Certain studies suggested a possible link between a high incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) among professional American football players and Italian soccer players, and certain sports supplements including BCAAs. In mouse studies, BCAAs were shown to cause cell hyper-excitability resembling that usually observed in ALS patients.</p>
            <br> <h2 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Cell signaling</h2>
            <br><p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">While most amino acids are oxidized in the liver, BCAAs are primarily oxidized in the skeletal muscle and other peripheral tissues. The effects of BCAA administration on muscle growth in rat diaphragm was tested, and concluded that not only does a mixture of BCAAs alone have the same effect on growth as a complete mixture of amino acids, but an amino acid mixture with all but BCAAs has no effect on rat diaphragm muscle growth. </p>
            <br><hr><h1 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Caffeine</h1>
            <img style="box-shadow: 0 8px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);" width="10%" src="pics/Caffeine_structure.svg.png" alt="Caffeine_structure.svg.png" /> 
            <br><p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. Caffeine is most promiment an adenosine receptor antagonist, meaning that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptors and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
            <br><h2 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Safe Doses</h2>
            <br><p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">The European Food Safety Authority reported that up to 400 mg of caffeine per day (around 5.7 mg/kg of body mass per day) does not raise safety concerns for non-pregnant adults, while intakes up to 200 mg per day for pregnant and lactating women do not raise safety concerns for the fetus or the breast-fed infants. A cup of coffee contains 80–175 mg of caffeine, depending on what "bean" (seed) is used, how it is roasted (darker roasts have less caffeine), and how it is prepared (e.g., drip, percolation, or espresso). Thus it requires roughly 50–100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach the toxic dose. However, pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a dietary supplement, can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts.</p>
            <br><h3 style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Adults</h3>
            <br><p style="color:white; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">For the general population of healthy adults, Health Canada advises a daily intake of no more than 400 mg. This limit was found to be safe by a 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology.</p>
